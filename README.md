# **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp Projects**

## Python env setup vs code

* python -m venv .venv

## Git commit style

* API relevant changes
  * `feat` Commits, that adds a new feature
  * `fix` Commits, that fixes a bug
* `refactor` Commits, that rewrite/restructure your code, however does not change any behaviour
  * `perf` Commits are special `refactor` commits, that improve performance
* `style` Commits, that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* `test` Commits, that add missing tests or correcting existing tests
* `docs` Commits, that affect documentation only
* `build` Commits, that affect build components like build tool, ci pipeline, dependencies, project version, ...
* `ops` Commits, that affect operational components like infra
